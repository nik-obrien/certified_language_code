Certified Language Code - Repository Description

In my current professional position I code in R, SQL and VBA however during my free time I'm working towards certification in Python, C++ and JavaScript.

The courses I'm taking are listed here:

    2020 Complete Python Bootcamp: From Zero To Hero In Python | Taught By Jose Portilla | Hosted By Udemy
  
    Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner To Beyond | Taught By Tim Buchalka | Hosted By Udemy
  
    The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero To Expert | Taught By Jonas Schmedtmann | Hosted By Udemy

This repository will contain strictly work I did for projects in these courses. Any recreational code I write in these languages will be hosted elsewhere.
